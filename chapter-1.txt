Chapter One

This is where the story begins. It was a dark and stormy night. The wind was blowing and the rain was driving.

I am adding even more here. Is it enough yet for this test?

And so our story began. Or did it? I don't really know. It doesn't really matter. What matters is: this file is being updated. I'm adding to the story. I doubt if I have word wrap turned on. Nope, looks like I don't.

So There you have it.

Continuing with the chapter, this is a new paragraph. This is part of a bigger story, one that has yet to be told successfully or at least, clearly.

And this is another chapter. I'm going to stop here for this session.

Our story continues now, as it should, with some more writing. Because that's what writers do: they write. I could just use ipsum lorem text, but I feel like typing some today.

So I have been typing.

Here is a small update to chapter one.
